# About Me, Myself, and this Site^[[Oxford Comma FTW!](https://www.ft.com/content/bdfb60aa-12ef-11e7-b0c1-37e417ee6c76)]

## Me

I'm a Combat Veteran^[Army / Mechanized Infantry] turned Accidental Academic / Social Scientist^[Communication Science and Political Science, B.A. thesis on ["Fifty Shades of Data"](https://www.authorea.com/users/168476/articles/196592-fifty-shades-of-data-ba-thesis-eprint)] turned PR Assistant / [SciComm Aficionado](https://medium.com/@Fubits/urbane-r%C3%A4ume-proteste-weltpolitik-21f05d512cc4) turned Computational Social Scientist^[(My Master's degree is literally just Political Science as a major and (Applied) Computer Science as a "minor", rooted in my own little epistemology for data-driven "(arti)facts". My upcoming thesis will be on predicting crises with geodata and deep learning], based in Berlin, Germany.

## This Site

Mostly, I'll be writing about solutions to problems you didn't know you had or won't ever have since you're not using Windows 10. My current **focus** is on creating stuff with R (SNA, DataViz, Maps, Publishing/Writing/Blogging). However, Python + Machine Learning / Deep Learning is around the corner, so feel free to check back later.

After all, it's [#SummerOfMachineLearning](https://twitter.com/fubits/status/981532034106576901):

## Projects
My largest **project** so far was being a `Digital Officer` (project-based, 1 year) for a large German think tank's shot at digital publishing, digitally supported research, and digitized science communication. I also wrote a bit on the [methodology](https://projekt.swp-berlin.org/urbaneraeume/kapitel/zur-methode/#aufbau-konzept-und-tools-der-webseite) (in German) re: `digital tools` & the makings of the project's `website`. You can find out more [here](https://medium.com/@Fubits/urbane-r%C3%A4ume-proteste-weltpolitik-21f05d512cc4) (in German) or have your own look at the visuals [here](https://projekt.swp-berlin.org/urbaneraeume/kapitel/blacklivesmatter/#chronologie-blacklivesmatter).
