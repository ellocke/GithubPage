# About Me, Myself,^[I love the [Oxford Comma](https://www.ft.com/content/bdfb60aa-12ef-11e7-b0c1-37e417ee6c76) and footnotes, btw, and most likely, you will find it annoying after some time.] and I / This Site

I'm a Combat Veteran^[Army / Mechanized Infantry, with some tours to some of the more prominents "stans", to be slightly more precise] turned Accidental Academic / Social Scientist^[Communication Science and Political Science, B.A. thesis on ["Fifty Shades of Data"](https://www.authorea.com/users/168476/articles/196592-fifty-shades-of-data-ba-thesis-eprint)] turned PR spook / SciComm Aficionado turned  Computational Social Scientist^[(My Master's is literally just Political Science as a major and (Applied) Computer Science as a "minor", rooted in my own little epistemology for data-driven "(arti)facts". Upcoming thesis will be on predicting crises (plural) with geocomputation and deep learning], based in Berlin, Germany. 

Mostly, I'll write about solutions to problems you didn't know you had or won't ever have since you're not using Windows 10. My current **focus** is on creating stuff with R (SNA, DataViz, Maps, Publishing/Writing/Blogging). However, Python + Machine Learning / Deep Learning is around the corner, so feel free to come by later.

After all, it's [#SummerOfMachineLearning](https://twitter.com/fubits/status/981532034106576901)
