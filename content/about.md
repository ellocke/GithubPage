# About Me, Myself, and this Site[^0]

## Me

{{% right %}} ![fubits](/img/about/about_me.jpg "fubits") {{% /right %}}

I'm&nbsp;**Ilja**&nbsp;[ɪlʲˈja || Илья] – an Army Combat&nbsp;Veteran, turned Accidental Social Scientist[^1] turned PR Assistant / [SciComm Aficionado](https://medium.com/@Fubits/urbane-r%C3%A4ume-proteste-weltpolitik-21f05d512cc4), turned `Computational Social Scientist`[^2], turned `Developer & Designer`, based in Berlin, Germany.

I freelance as a developer, "data person"[^3], and product designer, and follow the path to become a **solution designer** :unicorn: for not-for-profit organizations.

Currently, I'm working as a `Tech Lead` at New America's D.C.-based <a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/" target="_blank">Ranking Digital Rights</a> project, where I'm responsible for the data infrastructure and information security. Before that I've been working for the Berlin-based <a href="https://www.hiig.de" target="_blank">Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society (HIIG)</a> and the <a href="https://www.swp-berlin.org/en/about-swp/" target="_blank">German Institute for International and Security Affairs</a> (SWP Berlin).

## This Site

One **focus** of mine is on creating reproducible stuff with R (SNA, NLP, DataViz, GIS/Maps, Publishing/Writing/Blogging) --- including this very kind of code-centric reporting / publishing as demonstrated by my website. This helps me explore and prototype the potentials of Code + Markdown + JS based workflows for **replication-friendly, data-driven, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">FOSS</a>-based Open Science and research communication** - academic or not.

Apart from that, I have entered the realm of (research) software engineering, and am currently developing a modular data management system, integrating `NodeJS`, `JavaScript` / `Google Apps Script` and the G-Suite environment. I'll talk more about this when we move beyond beta.

In general, what I do and how I interact with clients and employers is rooted in `Human-Centered Design` as defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9241" target="_blank">ISO 9241</a>. I enrich this approach by the better parts from Agile / Lean, and other process and project management frameworks.

## Freelancing

I'm always keen to explore ways to help not-for-profit organizations advance their mission. I create maps, data and information visualizations, or interactive stand-alone web apps with a low-dependency & low-maintenance stack (i.e. JAMstack - a static web site renderer with LTS JS framework versions & CC-based templates). Currently, I am implementing a tailored data management system based on JavaScript and full Google G-Suite integration. Check out my [**Portofolio**](/portfolio) page for a visual impression.

## Projects

My biggest **project** so far was being a `Digital Officer` (project-based, 1 year) for a big German think tank's shot at digital publishing, digitally supported research, and digitized science communication. I also wrote a bit on the [methodology](https://projekt.swp-berlin.org/urbaneraeume/kapitel/zur-methode/#aufbau-konzept-und-tools-der-webseite) (in German) re: `digital tools` & the makings of the project's `website`. You can find out more [here](https://medium.com/@Fubits/urbane-r%C3%A4ume-proteste-weltpolitik-21f05d512cc4) (in German) or have your own look at the results [here](https://projekt.swp-berlin.org/urbaneraeume/kapitel/blacklivesmatter/#chronologie-blacklivesmatter).

# GPDR, Data Protection, Privacy

This is a **static site** written with R Markdown and compiled/rendered locally (with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) & by [Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)) on my laptop --- without a CMS, any data bases, cookies, trackers, or whatever. I don't run a mailing list, don't collect any data and there's nothing to opt in here [https://dadascience.design/*](https://dadascience.design/).

I just finished my thesis on Usability in Social Research, where I conducted a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of human-centered design for infrastructure development in non-profit contexts.
