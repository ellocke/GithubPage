## Me

{{% right %}} ![fubits](/img/about/about_me.jpg "fubits") {{% /right %}}

I'm&nbsp;**Ilja**&nbsp;[ɪlʲˈja || Илья] – a Combat&nbsp;Veteran^[Army / Mechanized Infantry] turned Accidental Social Scientist^[Communication Science and Political Science, B.A. thesis on ["Fifty Shades of Data"](https://www.authorea.com/users/168476/articles/196592-fifty-shades-of-data-ba-thesis-eprint)] turned PR Assistant / [SciComm Aficionado](https://medium.com/@Fubits/urbane-r%C3%A4ume-proteste-weltpolitik-21f05d512cc4) turned `Computational Social Scientist`^[(My Master's degree is literally just Political Science as a major and (Applied) Computer Science as a "minor", rooted in my own little epistemology of data-driven "(arti)facts". I just finished my thesis on Usability in Social Research, where I conducted a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of human-centered design for infrastructure development in non-profit contexts.], turned `Developer & Designer`, based in Berlin, Germany.

I freelance as a developer, "data person"^[Randy Au has written a very smart piece on being the first person to bring data science to a small organisations: "small companies don’t need a data scientist, but they need a “data person”. [Au 2019](https://towardsdatascience.com/succeeding-as-a-data-scientist-in-small-companies-startups-92f59e22bd8c?gi=fac5fd998179)], and product designer, and follow the path to become a **solution designer** for not-for-profit organisations :unicorn:.

Currently, I work as a `Technology Consultant` and `Developer` for New America's D.C.-based <a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/" target="_blank">Ranking Digital Rights</a> project. Before that I've worked for the Berlin-based <a href="https://www.hiig.de" target="_blank">Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society (HIIG)</a> and the <a href="https://www.swp-berlin.org/en/about-swp/" target="_blank">German Institute for International and Security Affairs</a> (SWP Berlin).

## This Site

One **focus** of mine is on creating reproducible stuff with R (SNA, NLP, DataViz, GIS/Maps, Publishing/Writing/Blogging) --- including this very kind of code-centric reporting / publishing as demonstrated by my website. This helps me explore and prototype the potentials of Code + Markdown + JS based workflows for **replication-friendly, data-driven, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">FOSS</a>-based Open Science and research communication** - academic or not.

Apart from that, I have entered the realm of (research) software engineering, and am currently developing a modular data management solution, integrating `NodeJS`, `JavaScript` / `Google Apps Script` and the G-Suite environment. I'll talk more about this when we move beyond beta.

In general, what I do and how I interact with clients and employers is rooted in `Human-Centered Design` as defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9241" target="_blank">ISO 9241</a>.

## Projects

My biggest **project** so far was being a `Digital Officer` (project-based, 1 year) for a big German think tank's shot at digital publishing, digitally supported research, and digitized science communication. I also wrote a bit on the [methodology](https://projekt.swp-berlin.org/urbaneraeume/kapitel/zur-methode/#aufbau-konzept-und-tools-der-webseite) (in German) re: `digital tools` & the makings of the project's `website`. You can find out more [here](https://medium.com/@Fubits/urbane-r%C3%A4ume-proteste-weltpolitik-21f05d512cc4) (in German) or have your own look at the results [here](https://projekt.swp-berlin.org/urbaneraeume/kapitel/blacklivesmatter/#chronologie-blacklivesmatter).

## Freelancing

I'm always exploring ways to help not-for-profit organisations advance their mission. I create maps, data and information visualisations, or interactive stand-alone web apps with a low-dependency & low-maintainance stack (i.e. static web site renderer with LTS JS framework versions & CC-based templates). Check out my [**Portofolio**](/portfolio) page for a visual impression.
