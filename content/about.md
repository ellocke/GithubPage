## Me

{{% right %}}![fubits](/img/about/about_me.jpg "fubits"){{% /right %}}

I'm&nbsp;a&nbsp;Combat&nbsp;Veteran^[Army / Mechanized Infantry] turned Accidental Academic / Social Scientist^[Communication Science and Political Science, B.A. thesis on ["Fifty Shades of Data"](https://www.authorea.com/users/168476/articles/196592-fifty-shades-of-data-ba-thesis-eprint)] turned PR Assistant / [SciComm Aficionado](https://medium.com/@Fubits/urbane-r%C3%A4ume-proteste-weltpolitik-21f05d512cc4) turned `Computational Social Scientist`^[(My Master's degree is literally just Political Science as a major and (Applied) Computer Science as a "minor", rooted in my own little epistemology for data-driven "(arti)facts". My upcoming thesis will be focussed on ~~predicting crises with geodata and deep learning~~ exploring the potential of {UI|UX|HCI} research methods for prototyping computational social science as a practice], based in Berlin, Germany.

Currently, I'm working for the Berlin-based <a href="https://www.hiig.de" target="_blank">Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society (HIIG)</a> & the D.C.-based <a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/" target="_blank">Ranking Digital Rights</a> research initiative.

## This Site

My current **focus** is on creating stuff with R (SNA, NLP, DataViz, GIS/Maps, Publishing/Writing/Blogging) --- including this very kind of code-centric reporting / blogging as demonstrated with this website ---, and thereby exploring/prototyping the potential of Code + Markdown + JS based workflows for **replication-friendly, data-driven, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">FOSS</a>-based Open Science** - academic or not.

## Projects

My biggest **project** so far was being a `Digital Officer` (project-based, 1 year) for a big German think tank's shot at digital publishing, digitally supported research, and digitized science communication. I also wrote a bit on the [methodology](https://projekt.swp-berlin.org/urbaneraeume/kapitel/zur-methode/#aufbau-konzept-und-tools-der-webseite) (in German) re: `digital tools` & the makings of the project's `website`. You can find out more [here](https://medium.com/@Fubits/urbane-r%C3%A4ume-proteste-weltpolitik-21f05d512cc4) (in German) or have your own look at the results [here](https://projekt.swp-berlin.org/urbaneraeume/kapitel/blacklivesmatter/#chronologie-blacklivesmatter).

## Freelancing

From time to time, I'm exploring ways to help not-for-profit organisations advance their mission. I create maps, data visualisations, or interactive stand-alone web apps with a low-dependency & low-maintainance stack (i.e. static web site renderer with LTS JS framework versions & CC-based templates). Check out my [portofolio](/portfolio) for a visual impression.
