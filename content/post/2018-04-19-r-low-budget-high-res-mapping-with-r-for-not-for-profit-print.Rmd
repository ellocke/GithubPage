![*(Spoiler: final version of the map)*](/img/mapping_talk/map_final_v20_96dpi.png "#MyFirstMap"){width=100%}

>*Presented as a Lightning Talk at [CODE/GEO/GRAPHIC, Berlin, 19 April 2018](http://code-geo-graphic.com/)*

>*(This is my first ever "how-to", so please be so kind and point me to any errors and feel free to help me improve my code and approach!)*

# Setting
Once upon a time (and long before I learned about the [tidyverse](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tidyverse?src=hash) and %>%), a colleague from a not-for-profit org asked for help with a map for a book. The conversation may or may not have sounded like that:

>*We need a map for a book but we don't have a budget.*\
>*And we need the map to be based on license-free material (no CC, no Leaflet, no OSM).*\
>*And it will be printed in black & white.*\
>*And we need some states to be grouped in four regions in total.*\
>*And you know that the editors work with MS Word...*


# Workflow
"Simple" 3-step-process (actually 4):

* find Public Domain / CC-0 geodata (vector & raster)
* render the geodata as SVG
* polish SVG in Illustrator / **Affinity** Designer et al.
* (fit SVG to PDF page)

How hard could that be, right?

## Packages
```{r message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(maps)
library(ggthemes)
library(rasterVis)
library(maptools)
library(sp)
library(here)
# library(rnaturalearth) # <- source for geodata, but pkg masks some needed fun() from other packages, so rather address methods by rnaturalearth::fun() 
```


## Geodata: World Map Data from Natural Earth

>*"Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software."* [(Natural Earth)](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/){target="_blank"}


**Base Map (Admin-0 Level)**

Let's first import the geodata and check the basemap.

```{r echo=TRUE}
world <- rnaturalearth::countries110
plot(world)
```

Ugh, not so pretty, right? But you have to start somewhere...

>**Spoiler:** Some Geo-Objects – which were only mentioned later on – are missing at Admin-0 level.

**-> Fetch Non-Admin-0 Elements (Guam & Singapore)**

```{r}
# countries10 <- rnaturalearth::ne_download(scale = 10,
#                                           type = 'countries',
#                                           category = 'cultural')
# save(countries10, file = "GIS_NPO_Data/countries10.rda")
data_path <- here("data", "GIS_NPO_Data", "/")
load(str_c(data_path, "countries10.rda"))
```


**Where's Guam?**
```{r}
# First, let's search for Guam:
# "Guam" %in% rnaturalearth::countries110$SOVEREIGNT #> FALSE, not "souvereign"
# Let's search below Admin-0 level within rnaturalearth::ne_states() 
# world.sub <- rnaturalearth::ne_states()
# head(world.sub, 1) # > either $name or $geounit
# "Guam" %in% world.sub$geonunit #> TRUE (vs. $name <- might be cruical for some)
Guam <- rnaturalearth::ne_states(geounit = 'guam')
Guam$category <- "D" # 4 regions A-D, as requested by colleague
plot(Guam)
```

**Where's Singapore?**
```{r}
#> "Singapore" %in% rnaturalearth::countries110$SOVEREIGNT is FALSE, so apparently,
# it is a souvereign state, but as a city-state too *granular* for the 1:110m data.
#
# Let's have a look in the 1:10m data

Singapore <- countries10[countries10$SOVEREIGNT == 'Singapore',]
# "Singapore" %in% world.sub$geonunit #> is also TRUE, while
# "Guam" %in% countries10$SOVEREIGNT is FALSE
# Caution: Scope of data from countries110 & countries10 might differ!
Singapore$category <- "C"
plot(Singapore)
```


## Assemble the Regions

**China**
```{r}
asia_china <- world[world$sovereignt == 'China',]
asia_china$category <- "A"
plot(asia_china)
```


**Eastern Asia (== `$subregion` minus China & Mongolia )**
```{r}
asia_east <- world[world$subregion == 'Eastern Asia' &
                     world$sovereignt != 'Mongolia' &
                     world$sovereignt != 'China',]
asia_east$category <- "D"
plot(asia_east)
```


**South-Eastern Asia**
```{r}
asia_seast <- world[world$subregion == 'South-Eastern Asia',]
asia_seast$category <- "C"
plot(asia_seast)
```


**Central and South Asia (plus Russia & Mongolia)**
```{r}
asia_censouth <- world[world$region_wb == 'South Asia' |
                         world$subregion == 'Central Asia' |
                         world$sovereignt == 'Mongolia' |
                         world$sovereignt == 'Russia',]
asia_censouth$category <- "B"
plot(asia_censouth)
```

>**Why Russia, why?** (cf. [Thread](https://twitter.com/HalukaMB/status/974674444970020867) & [Solution for QGIS ](https://twitter.com/HalukaMB/status/982306518522527744) by [Haluka](https://twitter.com/HalukaMB)
)

**Solution: Set left `BBOX`-Border to clip off Russia's overlapping Tail**
```{r}
leftBorder <- 25
asia_censouth@bbox[1] <- leftBorder
plot(asia_censouth)
```


**Consolidate the Core**
```{r}
asia_core <-  spRbind(
                spRbind(
                  spRbind(asia_china, asia_east),
                     asia_seast),
                        asia_censouth) # or just %>% next time :)
asia_core@bbox[1] <- leftBorder
plot(asia_core)
```


**Consolidate the Rest**

*(Preview)*
```{r}
asia_rest <- world[world$region_un == "Asia" &
                     world$sovereignt != 'China' | 
                     world$region_un == "Oceania" | 
                     world$region_un == "Africa" |
                     world$region_un == "Europe",]
asia_rest@bbox[1] <- leftBorder
plot(asia_rest)
```


**Remove the Core**
```{r}
asia_rest <- subset.data.frame(asia_rest,
                              !(asia_rest$sovereignt %in% asia_core$sovereignt))
asia_rest@bbox[1] <- leftBorder
plot(asia_rest)
```


## Convert Spatial Dataframe to Tidy Dataframe
> (This was done before [`geom_sf` / `ggsf`](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html) were introduced to [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html). There might exist a far more efficient solution right now, esp. with `ggplot2`.)

> 2019 Update: There exists a [far more efficient solution](post/r-gis-like-it-s-2019-pragmatic-workflows-pt-1/), esp. with `{sf, mapview, geom_sf, ... }`

**Tidy the Vector Data**
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
asia_core@data$id <- row.names(asia_core@data)
Singapore@data$id <- row.names(Singapore@data)
Guam@data$id <- row.names(Guam@data)
asia_main <- broom::tidy(asia_core)
asia_main <- dplyr::left_join(asia_main, asia_core@data, by = 'id')
head(asia_main, 1)
```

**Create centered Country Labels**
```{r echo=TRUE}
centroids_df <- as.data.frame(coordinates(asia_core)) # returns centered points
centroids_df$sovereignt <- asia_core$sovereignt # add country names

# I had to include Guam and Singapore only after I already rendered the core
# map, so this is my rather awkward work-around to include them subsequently
sing_centroids_df <- as.data.frame(coordinates(Singapore))
sing_centroids_df$sovereignt <- Singapore$SOVEREIGNT
centroids_df <- rbind(centroids_df, sing_centroids_df)
Guam_centroids_df <- as.data.frame(coordinates(Guam))
Guam_centroids_df$sovereignt <- Guam$name
centroids_df <- rbind(centroids_df, Guam_centroids_df)

# rename the colnames
names(centroids_df) <- c("Long", "Lat", "Name")
head(centroids_df, 1)
```


## Relief Raster

**Get the Relief Raster File**
```{r echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
# Either:
# physics <- rnaturalearth::ne_download(scale = 50, category = 'raster',
#                                       type = 'NE2_50M_SR_W', load = TRUE)

# OR:
# Download from: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-raster-data/
# Here: NE2, shaded relief, water: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/50m/raster/NE2_50M_SR_W.zip
relief_world <- raster(str_c(data_path, "NE2_50M_SR_W.tif")) # 170 MB file
plot(relief_world)
```


**(If needed: reduce Raster Resolution)**
```{r include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
# reduce resolution by 50% (I didn't do it since we want high-res for print)
# s2 <- aggregate(s, fact = 2)
# plot(s2)
```


**Crop the Raster File**
```{r, cache=TRUE}
# deprecated:
# manually select the box for the region with mouse pointer -> quick but bad!!!
# s <- raster::select(relief)
# plot(s)

# OR:
# Crop around dataframe
# relief_sub <- crop(relief, extent(asia_rest))

# OR
# Clean & easy: just define the extend of the box
box <- extent(25, 155, -25, 60) # how to calculate ratio (i.e. 1: 1,48)?
relief_boxcrop <- crop(relief_world, box)
plot(relief_boxcrop)
```


**Raster for the Core Regions**
```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Mask everything apart from the core regions terrain
# relief_land <- raster::mask(relief_boxcrop, asia_core) # mask {E} != asia_core
# save(relief_land, file = "../../data/GIS_NPO_Data/relief_land.rda")
load(str_c(data_path, "relief_land.rda"))
plot(relief_land)
```


**Convert Core Raster to SPDF to DF**
```{r}
# Raster to SPDF
relief_land_spdf <- as(relief_land, "SpatialPixelsDataFrame")
# SPDF to DF (for ggplot)
relief_land_df <- as.data.frame(relief_land_spdf) %>% 
  rename(value = `NE2_50M_SR_W`)
head(relief_land_df, 1)
```


**Raster for the Rest (Water & Terrain)**
```{r, cache=TRUE}
# relief_meer <- raster::mask(relief_boxcrop, asia_core, inverse=TRUE) # maskiert alles == asia_core
# save(relief_meer, file = "../../data/GIS_NPO_Data/relief_meer.rda")
load(str_c(data_path, "relief_meer.rda"))
plot(relief_meer)
```


**Convert 2nd Raster to DF**
```{r}
relief_meer_spdf <- as(relief_meer, "SpatialPixelsDataFrame")
relief_meer_df <- as.data.frame(relief_meer_spdf) %>% 
  rename(value = `NE2_50M_SR_W`)
head(relief_meer_df, 1)
```

Not perfect, but sufficient for post-processing the output SVG with a vector processing app. One issue I wasn't able to dissolve, is the different interpretations of the left border set to 25. While the raster definitively is cropped to 25°, the polygons extend beyond that. I'm quite sure that this is because of [Kaliningrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaliningrad), so I guess it should be possible to ID the **exclave** by "String %in% $var" and exclude it from the dataframe. I might test that later.

Since the map was going to be printed in BW, I decided to provide at least some relieve with regards to the overloaded color scheme. Remember: While ColorBrewer recommends a max of 3 color levels for BW, this map has 4 shades of grey for the 4 core regions, 1 color for water (and borders), and another grey shade for countries which are not part of the core region. Add black for the labels and we end up with 7 colors. So leaving water areas and the rest of the world without relief, while highlighting the core regions by underlying them with a relief kind of works here. Don't @ me :)

## Final Processing of Output SVG in Affinity Photo / Designer
![*"Processing the SVG in Affinity"*](/img/mapping_talk/map_affinity.jpg "Processing the SVG"){width=100%}


Basically, I just scaled the SVG to 300 dpi, changed the fonts, moved the labels and slightly readjusted the alpha levels of the regions.
That's it. We're done here.
(PS: We're not, since someone has to blog about it and maybe even hold it as a lighting talk at a cool workshop)

# Lessons Learned

* ([Map Projections, anyone?](https://xkcd.com/977/))

* Print != "JPEG". We need high-res data and have to check for artifacts (i.e. small islands which might be rendered with 1px and then be printed as "corns")

* Demand **precise** specifics:

    
    + Full list of ALL **features**
  
    + Print **dimensions** for the map (absoulte in cm/inch or ratio)
  
    + Publication/**layout** dimensions (page size, font size, orientation/layout, keep in mind 300dpi)
    
    + Check whether there's some **Corporate Design** Manual (i.e. for fonts & colors)
  
    + Will there be a **caption**? -> If yes, leave some space for it.
    
    + For printing on white paper: do we need a black **border** around the map?
    
    + **Probably best way to start with is to ask for a *sketch*!**

* Show-case your first **prototype** as early as possible -> early error detection

* Let your "client" double-check geopolitical **pitfalls** (think Crimea!)

* Black & white printing: For the sake of **inclusion** and quality: do not use more than 3 shades of grey (plus white)

* For colorized printing: Think about those 10% with **reduced red/green vision** (-> consult [ColorBrewer2](http://colorbrewer2.org))

* Explicitly agree on **credits** for your work (and actually, try to agree on a CC-licensing)

* Encountered some problems and found a way out? --> **Share your knowledge**: Blog / GitHub / Present / Discuss / Revise

* Send the final version as a pre-rendered **robust PDF**.

**Thanks for reading!**
