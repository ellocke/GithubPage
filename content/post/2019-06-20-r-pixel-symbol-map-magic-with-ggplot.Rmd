# \#TidyTuesday

Last week, [Lisa Hehnke's](https://twitter.com/DataPlanes){target="_blank"} [#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TidyTuesday?src=hash){target="_blank"}-contribution on Twitter got me really excited: She created an animated pixel map of all meteoroid impacts from 1900 to 2010:

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1138532858442784768')
```

As I was experimenting with symbols & dataviz for a client recently, I felt inspired to play around a bit with the potentials of combining pixels + symbols and some basic design tweaks. I was surprised how straightforward this was with R so I decided to share my approach. 

**Prerequisites**

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(maps)
library(extrafont) # + (Yanone Kaffeesatz and Font Awesome 4.7)
# install.packages(c("ggthemes", "emojifont", "scales"))
```

# The Dots

First, we need to turn the world into pixels.

> All the Kudos here go to [Taras Kaduk](https://medium.com/taras-kaduk/r-walkthrough-create-a-pixel-map-537ce12c2f0c){target="_blank"} who pioneered the pixel map approach with `maps::map.where()` in 2017. Give his Medium piece some `r emojifont::emoji("clap")`!

The toughest part is tweaking the proper relation between this "rasterisation" and the `geom_point` size / `fig.width` size parameters. This is probably something where you will need to play around. My primary approach was to keep the `geom_point` size / `fig.width` size constant for `ggplot` and tweak the `resolution` up here.

## World

```{r}
resolution <- 3
lat <- tibble(lat = seq(-90, 90, by = resolution))
long <- tibble(long = seq(-180, 180, by = resolution))
dots <- merge(lat, long, all = TRUE) %>%
        mutate(country = maps::map.where("world", long, lat), # the magic
               lakes = maps::map.where("lakes", long, lat)) %>% 
        filter(!is.na(country) & is.na(lakes)) %>%
        select(-lakes)

head(dots, 3) %>% knitr::kable("html")
```

## Capitals

Let's also fetch all the world capitals with a population of 1 million and more. I sticked to the KISS-principle^[KISS := Keep It Simple, Stupid] here and just round the coordinates to the nearest whole number. Whatever works, works.

```{r}
capitals <- maps::world.cities %>%
  filter(capital == 1 & pop >= 1000000) %>% 
  mutate(lat = round(lat, 0),
         long = round(long, 0)) %>% 
  rename(country = country.etc) %>% 
  select(lat, long, country, name, pop)

head(capitals, 3) %>% knitr::kable("html")
```

> You obviously could countries and capitals them into a single `data.frame` and then filter/subset.

# Pixel Time

## World Pixel Map

We just need to resort to `geom_point(size = 1)`. Let's have a look at the base map without the capitals, first:

```{r}
(pixelmap_base <- ggplot() + 
   geom_point(data = dots, aes(x = long, y = lat), color = "black", size = 1)
)
```

> Not too bad, right? Now let's add the capital cities and some opinionated design on top.

```{r fig.width=7, out.width='100%'}
pixelmap_base + 
   geom_point(data = capitals, aes(x = long, y = lat), color = "#ffffff", size = 1) +
   coord_sf(datum = NA,
         # crs = 4326,
         crs = 54009, 
         clip = "on",
         ylim = c(-75, 85),
         xlim = c(-160, 170)) +
   labs(title = "Pixel Map Magic",
        subtitle = str_c("World capitals with a population of more than 1 million. Made with ",
                         emojifont::emoji("heart"), " and R"),
        caption = "@fubits") +
  # theme_void() +
   ggthemes::theme_map() +
   theme(text = element_text(family = "Yanone Kaffeesatz Light", color = "gold"),
         plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#212121", colour = NA), 
         title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 18),
         plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = "#ffffff", face = "plain", size = 12),
         plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, vjust = 10, hjust = 0.98),
         plot.margin = margin(12,12,0,12)
         )
```

> Whoop whoop. What else can we do? Let's replace the capital city **dots** with **symbols** (aka Font Awesome glyphs; but you could use **Emojis** or whatever **Unicode** symbol existing in a Font) and scale their size with the respective city's population.

## World Pixel Map with Symbols

Easiest way to handle fonts (at least on Windows) is to fetch the `.ttf` font file, install it on your system, and then use the `extrafont` package to import and load the fonts into the R session. This way, all you have to do post-import is to load the `extrafont` package or to run `extrafont::loadfonts(device)`. On windows, use `device = "win"`. Also, for reasons unknown, I could not get to render some glyphs from `Font Awesome 5`, so I just sticked to `Font Awesome 4.7`. And loading the ``emojifont` package kills the `extrafont` binding. So here's my been-there-so-you-dont-have-to-struggle approach:

```{r fig.width=7, out.width='100%'}
pixelmap_base + 
   # geom_point(data = capitals, aes(x = long, y = lat), color = "#ffffff", size = 1) + 
   geom_text(data = capitals, aes(x = long, y = lat, size = pop),
             label = emojifont::fontawesome("fa-male"), # also: "\uf183" for Unicode
             family = "FontAwesome", color = "#ffffff") + # or copy/paste glyphs
   scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(2),
                         range = c(1,4)) + # downscaling for web
   coord_sf(datum = NA,
             # crs = 4326,
             crs = 54009,
             clip = "off",
             ylim = c(-75, 85),
             xlim = c(-160, 170)) +
   labs(title = "Pixel+Symbol Map Magic",
        subtitle = str_c("World capitals with a population of more than 1 million. Made with ",
                         emojifont::emoji("heart"), " and R"),
        caption = "@fubits") +
   theme_void() +
   theme(text = element_text(family = "Yanone Kaffeesatz Light", color = "gold"),
         plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#212121", colour = NA), 
         title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 18),
         plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = "#ffffff", face = "plain", size = 12),
         plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, vjust = 10, hjust = 0.98),
         plot.margin = margin(12,12,0,12),
         legend.position = c(0.1,0.33),
         legend.title = element_blank(),
         legend.text = element_text(size = 10)
        )
```

## World Pixel Map with Symbols and inverted color logic

When we do **design** or dataviz, we want to draw the reader's full **attention** to our **message**. One easy way to do this here is to align the **colors** of the subtitle, the geom, and the legend's key:

```{r fig.width=7, out.width='100%'}
pixelmap_base + 
   # geom_point(data = capitals, aes(x = long, y = lat), color = "#ffffff", size = 1) + 
   geom_text(data = capitals, aes(x = long, y = lat, size = pop),
             label = emojifont::fontawesome("fa-male"),
             family = "FontAwesome", color = "gold") +
   scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(2),
                         range = c(1,4)) + # downscaling for web
   coord_sf(datum = NA,
             # crs = 4326,
             crs = 54009,
             clip = "off",
             ylim = c(-75, 85),
             xlim = c(-160, 170)) +
   labs(title = "Pixel+Symbol Map Magic",
        subtitle = str_c("World capitals with a population of more than 1 million. Made with ",
                         emojifont::emoji("heart"), " and R"),
        caption = "@fubits") +
   theme_void() +
   theme(text = element_text(family = "Yanone Kaffeesatz Light", color = "#ffffff"),
         plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#212121", colour = NA), 
         title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 18),
         plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = "gold", face = "plain", size = 12),
         plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, colour = "gold", vjust = 10, hjust = 0.98),
         plot.margin = margin(12,12,0,12),
         legend.position = c(0.1,0.33),
         legend.title = element_blank(),
         legend.text = element_text(size = 10)
        )
```

So tell me again how you can't use R in production ...
