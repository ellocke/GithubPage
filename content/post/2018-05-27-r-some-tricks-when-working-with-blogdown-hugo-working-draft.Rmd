# Fix your Table of Contents / TOC (with .Rmd)

If for your theme the TOC is not working as expected or you simply want back the familiar Knitr-style TOC

   * set `toc = false` in `config.toml`
   * remove `toc: <boolean>` from the `yaml` header of your post
   * and insert  
   
```
output:
  blogdown::html_page:
      toc: TRUE
```
Mind the tabs!

## Numbering

If you want numbering (in your TOC and for your headings/chapters), add `number_sections: true` to `yaml`

```
output:
  blogdown::html_page:`
      number_sections: true
      toc: TRUE
```

## Custom TOC & Numbering CSS
If numbering is not pre-defined in your theme, you might need to add a `custom.css` as a **Parameter** to `config.toml` and then do some formatting in `CSS`:

  + `config.toml`
    ```
    [params]
      customCSS = ["custom.css"]
    ```
    
>Notice that your `custom.css` has to be saved in `\static\css\`

  + Now add the following definitions to your `custom.css`
    ```
    /* Numbering suffix in TOC */
    .toc-section-number:after{
    	content: ". "
    }
    
    /* Numbering suffix in Body/Content */
    .header-section-number:after{
    	content: ". "
    }
    ```
    
I'm not sure whether the `CSS-selectors` are the same for all templates but you can figure them out easily by running some Page Inspector/Web Development Tools in your browser (just right-click an object and search for a similar function). You can even do this from RStudio's preview pane btw!

##TOC-Heading (i.e. "Outline")

And last but not least, your TOC currently has no Heading/Title, so if you want one include this in your
  
  + `custom.css`:

    ```
    /* Add some Heading / Title before the TOC */
    #TOC:before{
    	content: "Outline";
    	font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif!important;
      	font-weight:400;
    	font-size: 26px;
    }
    ```

## TOC & Summary
If you're using a theme which displays a summary on your site's index.html, you'll notice that the contents of TOC will now be included in your summary. See here how to fix your theme's summary: 

# Summary / {{ .Summary}}
By default, Hugo 

  + a.) simply parses the first 70 characters of a post (stripped of any html). Or
  + b.) looks for a `<!--more-->` line in your post's content. Hugo then simply parses all the content until it reaches`<!--more-->`.
  
In order to fix this / automate your own summary, IMHO the easiest workaround seems to be to change the variable `.Summary` to `.Description` in your theme's `summary.html` template (you'll find it here: `<PageSource>\themes\<your-theme>\layouts\post\summary.html`) and use `description = 'text'` in your post's `YAML` header instead.

  + edit `summary.html` and find the following passage:
  
    ```
    <!-- Content -->
    <div class="post-content">
      <div class="post-summary">
        {{ .Summary }}
      </div>
      <div class="read-more">
        <a href="{{ .URL }}" class="read-more-link">{{ T "readMore" }}</a>
      </div>
    </div>
    ```
  
  + replace `{{ .Summary }}` with `{{ .Description }}`
  
Now in your **post's**

  + `yaml`-header write insert your own "summary" with the `description: ''` parameter:

    `description: "This post is about something something."`
