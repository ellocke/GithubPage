Last week, I [mined almost 5K Tweets](/post/r-academic-conference-twitter-pt-1-mining-dvpw18-dgs18-hist18-et-al/) from the annual meetings of five German academic societies. Now it's about time that we dive into the contents with [Kenneth Benoit's](https://twitter.com/kenbenoit){target="_blank"} powerful `quanteda` Package. Come for the corpus approaches to text as data, stay for the Turkish Plot-Twist...

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(rtweet) # just in case we want to look up something on Twitter
library(quanteda)
quanteda_options("threads" = 4)
# quanteda_options("threads")
```

# Import Tweets from `.rds`

Please see [Twitter pt. 1](/post/r-academic-conference-twitter-pt-1-mining-dvpw18-dgs18-hist18-et-al/) for Twitter Mining with `rtweet` and the details of the data handling approach.


**Prepare here()-path to the `.rds` data**

```{r}
data_path <- here("data", "ConferenceTweets", "/")
```

**Bulk-read the `.rds` files**

```{r}
dvpw_collection <- dir(path = data_path, pattern = "dvpw_") %>% 
  str_c(data_path, .) %>% 
  map_dfr(readRDS)
dvpw_collection <- dvpw_collection %>% distinct(status_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(created_at < "2018-09-30") %>%
  mutate(Discipline = "PolSci") %>% 
  arrange(created_at)

dgs_collection <- dir(path = data_path, pattern = "dgs_") %>% 
  str_c(data_path, .) %>% 
  map_dfr(readRDS)
dgs_collection <- dgs_collection %>% distinct(status_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(created_at < "2018-09-30") %>%
  mutate(Discipline = "Sociology") %>% 
  arrange(created_at)

hist_collection <- dir(path = data_path, pattern = "hist_") %>% 
  str_c(data_path, .) %>% 
  map_dfr(readRDS)
hist_collection <- hist_collection %>% distinct(status_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(created_at < "2018-09-30") %>%
  mutate(Discipline = "History") %>% 
  arrange(created_at)

inf_collection <- dir(path = data_path, pattern = "inf_") %>% 
  str_c(data_path, .) %>% 
  map_dfr(readRDS)
inf_collection <- inf_collection %>% distinct(status_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(created_at < "2018-09-30") %>%
  mutate(Discipline = "CS") %>% 
  arrange(created_at)
```

## Subset "Interdisciplinary" Tweets

Something I didn't account for last time, was the possibility that some Twitter Users might have been mentioning / monitoring multiple conferences, esp. with regards to the interrelation between Political Science, Sociology, and History. 

Let's single them out and assign a "Mixed" label.

```{r}
joint_collection <- bind_rows(dvpw_collection, dgs_collection,
                              hist_collection, inf_collection)

# build set of distinct 
joint_distinct <- joint_collection %>% 
  distinct(status_id, .keep_all = TRUE)

#subset duplicated
mixed_collection <- subset(joint_collection,
                      duplicated(joint_collection$status_id)) %>% 
  distinct(status_id, .keep_all = TRUE) # find duplicates

mixed_collection$Discipline <- "Mixed"
```

> Only `r mixed_collection %>% count()` Tweets? Out of a sample of almost 5K? Twitter Silos, anyone?

## Inspect "Interdisciplinary" Tweets

```{r echo=TRUE}
mixed_collection %>% 
  arrange(created_at) %>% 
  select(text) %>% head(10) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```


# Create Corpus

For further, "Corpus-based"" analysis (and beyond) we'll use the `quanteda` package.

I aim to re-do as much as I can from this series with [Julia Silge's](https://twitter.com/juliasilge){target="_blank"} `tidytext` package, soon, btw.

## Build Individual Corpora

As we already have singled out "interdisciplinary" Tweets, we'll just `anti_join()` every other tibble with the mixed Tweets.

```{r}
dvpw_corpus <- dvpw_collection %>%
  anti_join(mixed_collection, by = "status_id") %>% 
  corpus(docid_field = "status_id")
docvars(dvpw_corpus, "Discipline") <- "PolSci"

dgs_corpus <- dgs_collection %>% 
  anti_join(mixed_collection, by = "status_id") %>% 
  corpus(docid_field = "status_id")
docvars(dgs_corpus, "Discipline") <- "Sociology"

hist_corpus <- hist_collection %>% 
  anti_join(mixed_collection, by = "status_id") %>% 
  corpus(docid_field = "status_id")
docvars(hist_corpus, "Discipline") <- "History"

inf_corpus <- inf_collection %>% 
  anti_join(mixed_collection, by = "status_id") %>% 
  corpus(docid_field = "status_id")
docvars(inf_corpus, "Discipline") <- "CS"

mixed_corpus <- mixed_collection  %>% 
  corpus(docid_field = "status_id")
docvars(mixed_corpus, "Discipline") <- "Mixed"
```

## Create Joint Corpus

That's even easier thanks to Quanteda.

```{r}
joint_corpus <- dvpw_corpus + 
                dgs_corpus + 
                hist_corpus + 
                inf_corpus + 
                mixed_corpus
```

# Create DFM

For most really usuful approaches to "text as data" we'll need a sparse document-feature matrix (dfm). Doing this with quanteda is straight forward, but there are some less prominent Tweets.

## Naive

```{r}
joint_dfm <- dfm(joint_corpus,
                # groups = "Discipline",
                 remove_punct = TRUE, 
                 remove_url = TRUE, # it's a mess, without
                 tolower = TRUE,
                 verbose = FALSE) #for website readability
```

```{r}
topfeatures(joint_dfm, 20) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

We get `nfeat(joint_dfm)` = `r nfeat(joint_dfm)` features, but as we can see from the `topfeatures()` output, the top features are mostly (and unsurprisingly very common German words which are also know as `stopwords` in NLP).

## 2nd Attempt: Remove `stopwords("german")`
```{r}
joint_dfm <- dfm(joint_corpus,
                 # groups = "Discipline",
                 remove = stopwords("german"),
                 remove_punct = TRUE,
                 remove_url = TRUE,
                 tolower = TRUE,
                 verbose = FALSE)
topfeatures(joint_dfm, 20) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

> Apart from English tokens (to, on, is, for, of, a), common German words such as "beim" or "dass" are still included. The latter is rather weird...

### Inspect `quanteda's` built-in Stop Words

Since we've seen that "dass" is still included in our corpus, let's i.e. look at all `quanteda::stopwords("german")` starting with a "d":

```{r}
stopwords("german") %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  filter(str_detect(value, pattern = "^da.*")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

> Ok, "beim" is missing, and "daÃŸ" instead of "dass" suggests that `quanteda`'s German stopword list terms might need an update... :) 

Also, note how `stopwords("german")` consists of `r stopwords("german") %>% length() ` tokens. Just for comparison, `tidytext::stop_words` has a total of `r  tidytext::stop_words %>% count()` stopwords for English. So we probably will have to include custom stopword lists repeatedly.

> Of course, GitHub has you covered! Gene Diaz is maintaining a super-exhaustive list of stopwords for multiple languages:  [github.com/stopwords-iso](https://github.com/stopwords-iso){target="_blank"}

> We'll use the text file with the German stopwords: [stopwords-de.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-de/master/stopwords-de.txt){target="_blank"}

```{r message=FALSE}
ger_stopwords <- read_lines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-de/master/stopwords-de.txt")
# saveRDS(ger_stopwords, "ger_stopwords.rds")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
length(ger_stopwords) #> 621 stopwords
c(ger_stopwords, stopwords("german")) %>% length() #> 852
c(ger_stopwords, stopwords("german")) %>% unique() %>% length() #> 621
```

### Include Custom Stopwords and Remove English Stopwords
```{r}
c("dass", "beim") %in% ger_stopwords #> [1] TRUE TRUE
# custom_stopwords <- c("dass", "beim")
custom_stopwords <- setdiff(ger_stopwords, stopwords("german")) # only keep left set
```

```{r}
joint_dfm <- dfm(joint_corpus,
                 # groups = "Discipline",
                 remove = c(stopwords("german"),
                            stopwords("english"), # ONE
                            custom_stopwords, # TWO
                            min_nchar = 2), # THREE
                 remove_punct = TRUE,
                 remove_url = TRUE,
                 tolower = TRUE,
                 verbose = FALSE)
topfeatures(joint_dfm, 20) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

> Great. But ... what is "amp"???

### Inspect "Keyword in Context" `kwic()` for "amp"

```{r}
kwic(joint_corpus, "amp", window = 3)  %>%
  # vs. kwic(x, phrase("term1 term2"))
  as_tibble() %>% # needed for kwic()
  select(pre:post) %>%
  head(10) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

> "amp" == "\&amp" which is the `HTML` term for \& / ampersand (but "\&" is removed when we create the corpus with `remove_punct = TRUE`, so only "amp" remains. Cool.)

Remove "amp"

```{r}
custom_stopwords <- c(custom_stopwords, "amp")
# This way, we'll keep our custom "amp" and "innen"
joint_dfm <- dfm(joint_corpus,
                 # groups = "Discipline",
                 remove = c(stopwords("german"),
                            stopwords("english"),
                            custom_stopwords,
                            min_nchar = 2),
                 remove_punct = TRUE,
                 remove_url = TRUE,
                 tolower = TRUE,
                 verbose = FALSE)
topfeatures(joint_dfm, 20) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

> That's better. But what's up with "innen" and "bu"?

### Inspect the Tokens `"innen"` and `"bu"` `kwic()`.

```{r}
kwic(joint_corpus, "innen", window = 3)  %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% # needed for kwic()
  select(pre:post) %>%
  head(10) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

> Ok, so `"< / | * >innen"` is part of the gendered forms of plurals of German terms such as Colleagues, Citizens, Rassists et al. We might want to think of a robust solution - which should not be stemming - here. Maybe `ngrams=2` or some clever `str_c(<regex> + (* | /) + "innen"")` might help. But for now we'll just add `"innen"` as a stopword.

```{r}
custom_stopwords <- c(custom_stopwords, "innen")
joint_dfm <- dfm(joint_corpus,
                 # groups = "Discipline",
                 remove = c(stopwords("german"),
                            stopwords("english"),
                            custom_stopwords,
                            min_nchar = 2),
                 remove_punct = TRUE,
                 remove_url = TRUE,
                 tolower = TRUE,
                 verbose = FALSE)
topfeatures(joint_dfm, 20) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

# The Turkish Plot-Twist

## One last Mystery remains...

So what about `"bu"`?

> (Spoiler: [`@osymbaskanligi`](https://twitter.com/OSYMbaskanligi){target="_blank"} seems to be an offical governmental Turkish account... That already points at something bigger.)

```{r}
kwic(joint_corpus, "bu", window = 3) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% # needed for kwic()
  select(pre:post) %>%
  head(10) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

> Turkish? Huh? Seems like the Sociologists' hashtag (\#dgs18, \#dgs2018) was heaviliy used by the Turkish Twitter community, too.

```{r}
dgs_collection %>% filter(lang == "tr") %>% count() %>%
  knitr::kable("html")
```

> Oopsie... From the Sociology Corpus, `r dgs_collection %>% filter(lang == "tr") %>% count()` Tweets out of `r dgs_collection %>% count()` are labelled as Turkish...

> WHAT ELSE DID I MISS?

```{r}
dgs_collection %>% group_by(lang) %>% count() %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

> Yikes! So my result from the previous post were totally biased in favour of the Sociology Conference. And what language is `"und"` and what about the joint collection?

```{r}
joint_collection %>% group_by(lang) %>% count() %>% 
  filter(n > 2) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

> `lang == "tr"` and `lang == "und" ` definitly need some closer inspection.

> But before we do that, let's subset only the Tweets from the conferences' week. Maybe the Turkish and the German Sociology #dgs2018 did not overlap temporally... 

Fortunatly, `rtweet` has a really convenient time-series plotting function...

```{r}
dgs_collection %>% filter(lang == "tr" | lang == "de") %>% 
  group_by(lang) %>% 
  rtweet::ts_plot() +
    theme_minimal()
```

... unfortunately, I didn't use it last time...

> Key Learning: I could have avoided stepping into this trap if I had plotted the distribution of Tweets over time... Exploratory Data Analysis FTW.

This is what I would've seen, I had done it right:

```{r}
joint_collection %>%
  group_by(Discipline) %>% 
  rtweet::ts_plot() +
    theme_minimal()
```

> See that left peak around the 20th? Arghhhh!

Time to move on. As we have already set an upper time limit above (`filter(created_at < "2018-09-30")`), we now only have to include a lower time limit:

```{r}
joint_collection_week <- joint_collection %>% 
  filter(created_at > "2018-09-23")

joint_collection_week %>%
  group_by(lang) %>% 
  count() %>%
  filter(n > 2) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

Ok, that's already better, but there are still `r joint_collection_week %>% filter(lang=="tr") %>% count()` Turkish Tweets in the sample, and `r joint_collection_week %>% filter(lang=="und") %>% count()` Tweets for `lang == "und"`.

> It turns out, however, that `lang == "und"` (un)fortunatly means `language undefined` [cf. Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/a/2013/introducing-new-metadata-for-tweets.html){target="_blank"}...

Let's have a look at the remaining Turkish Tweets and then rebuild our corpora and the document-feature matrix.

```{r}
joint_collection_week %>%
  filter(lang == "tr") %>%
  select(text) %>% 
  head() %>% # for website readability
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2) 
```

So all the Tweets are exclusivly in Turkish, and it is more than appropriate to exclude them from our analysis here AND in my preceding blog post. (Update incoming!)

> But who's going to tell the German Sociologists that my report from last week had to be corrected and that they didn't perform that well, actually ...!?

> Key learning: Never rely on blind/nummeric analysises only. Always do some qualitative exploration and check for plausibility - even when it's "only" for a blog!!!

## Removing Turkish accounts

First, let's get list of all the Users who where part of the Turkish #dgs2018 sample (and since I've updated the previous post, I have collected some Turkish hashtags for `lang=="und"`, so we'll just re-use this filter here.)

```{r}
tr_user <- dgs_collection %>%
  filter(str_detect(text,"yks2018|yksdil|dgsankara|cumhuriyetÃ¼niversitesi|DanceKafe") | lang == "tr") %>% 
  select(user_id) %>% 
  distinct()
tr_user %>% count() %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

Now, we'll `anti_join()` the `dgs_collection` with this list

```{r}
dgs_collection %>% anti_join(tr_user, by = "user_id") %>% count() %>%
  knitr::kable("html")
```

Let's compare with the simpler `filter(lang!="tr")` approach

```{r}
dgs_collection %>% 
  filter(lang != "tr") %>% 
  count() %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

That's a difference of another ~30 Tweets. Nice. We'll use that in a minute.


# Rebuild the Corpus without Tweets with `lang=="tr"`

> There is two ways to do that. One is lazy and one is more replication-friendly. I'll mention the lazy one, but will continue with the more robust approach

**The Lazy Way**

(Two lazy ways, actually)

As we know that the Turkish Tweets are exclusively in the Sociology Corpus, we could just rebuild the `dgs_corpus` and then rebuild the `joint_corpus` with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
joint_corpus <- dvpw_corpus + 
                dgs_corpus + 
                hist_corpus + 
                inf_corpus + 
                mixed_corpus
```

An even easier way would be to filter out Turkish Tweets from the already existing `joint_corpus` with `quanteda::corpus_subset()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
joint_corpus %>% corpus_subset(joint_corpus$documents$lang != "tr")
```

However, if you have been jumping back and forth within this post (or `.Rmd` Notebook), then you (=me) might have lost track of the various manipulations and state differences (i.e. think of `custom_stopwords`). Plus, the `dgs_corpus` would still need attention, too, and as we've filtered out a lot of Tweets by setting a lower time limit, the common time period for the corpora would differ, too. BAD!

> So let's rebuild the corpora from scratch.

## Re-Build individual Corpora from Scratch

We'll just add `filter(created_at > "2018-09-23")` and for the sake of robustness, we'll filter all corpora for `lang != "tr"`, and `anti_join(dgs_corpus)` with `tr_user`.

**As I want both, discipline-specific copora with "multidisciplinary Tweets" and a redundancy-free joint corpus, I'll build the corpora in two steps.**

```{r}
dvpw_corpus <- dvpw_collection %>% 
  filter(created_at > "2018-09-23" & lang != "tr") %>% # combined filter()
  # anti_join(mixed_collection, by = "status_id") %>% 
  corpus(docid_field = "status_id", text_field = "text")
  ## not totally sure about the effect of setting text_field = "text"
docvars(dvpw_corpus, "Discipline") <- "PolSci"

dgs_corpus <- dgs_collection %>% 
  filter(created_at > "2018-09-23" & lang != "tr") %>%
  # anti_join(mixed_collection, by = "status_id") %>%
  anti_join(tr_user, by = "user_id") %>% 
  corpus(docid_field = "status_id", text_field = "text")
docvars(dgs_corpus, "Discipline") <- "Sociology"

hist_corpus <- hist_collection %>% 
  filter(created_at > "2018-09-23" & lang != "tr") %>%
  # anti_join(mixed_collection, by = "status_id") %>% 
  corpus(docid_field = "status_id", text_field = "text")
docvars(hist_corpus, "Discipline") <- "History"

inf_corpus <- inf_collection %>% 
  filter(created_at > "2018-09-23" & lang != "tr") %>%
  # anti_join(mixed_collection, by = "status_id") %>% 
  corpus(docid_field = "status_id", text_field = "text")
docvars(inf_corpus, "Discipline") <- "CS"

mixed_corpus <- mixed_collection %>% 
  filter(created_at > "2018-09-23" & lang != "tr") %>%
  corpus(docid_field = "status_id", text_field = "text") # 42 docs!
docvars(mixed_corpus, "Discipline") <- "Mixed"
```

> Of course, eventually, we should update and `rm()` all the obselete *_collection objects or simply consolidate all the "valid" Tweets in a .rds file. However, I'm not so much into editing raw-ish / original data, so doing that is up to you.

## Create Joint Corpus
```{r}
joint_corpus <- dvpw_corpus + 
                dgs_corpus + 
                hist_corpus + 
                inf_corpus # 3,748 docs

joint_corpus <- joint_corpus %>% corpus_subset(!(docnames(joint_corpus) %in% mixed_collection$status_id)) # 3,706 docs

joint_corpus <- joint_corpus + mixed_corpus #3,748 docs
```

# 3rd Attempt @ `dfm()` Building
```{r}
joint_dfm <- dfm(joint_corpus,
                # groups = "Discipline",
                 remove = c(stopwords("german"),
                            stopwords("english"),
                            custom_stopwords,
                            min_nchar = 3),
                 remove_punct = TRUE,
                 remove_url = TRUE,
                # remove_numbers = TRUE,
                 tolower = TRUE,
                 verbose = TRUE)
```

We're down to `r nfeat(joint_dfm)` features from `r ndoc(joint_dfm)` documents (Tweets) and were able to get rid of 608 features with the iteratively refined approach.

And as we might want to use a grouped dfm for group comparisons (and `dfm_group` doesn't seem to work for me here), we'll create a custom grouped one, too.

```{r}
## not working:
# dfm_group(joint_dfm, groups = "Discipline")
# OR
# dfm_group(joint_dfm, groups = c("Discipline"))
# OR
# dfm_group(joint_dfm, groups = docvars(joint_dfm, "Discipline"))
#> Error in qatd_cpp_is_grouped_numeric(as.numeric(x), group) : 
#>  (list) object cannot be coerced to type 'double'

joint_dfm_grouped <- dfm(joint_corpus,
                 groups = "Discipline",

# Some quick Analyses

## Top Hashtags

```{r}
hashtags_dfm <- dfm_select(joint_dfm, ('#*'), selection = "keep")
topfeatures(hashtags_dfm, 20, scheme = "count") %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

## Top Hashtags per Discipline

```{r results="asis"}
topfeatures(hashtags_dfm, 20,
            group = "Discipline",
            scheme = "count") %>% 
  map(knitr::kable, "html")
```

**Most popular Hashtags by shared `docfreq` / feature-document frequency:**

```{r}
dfm_select(joint_dfm_grouped, ('#*')) %>% 
  topfeatures(30, scheme = "docfreq") %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

## Top Features

> Without Hashtags and Twitter @Nicks

```{r}
# {r results="asis"}
features <- dfm_select(joint_dfm, pattern = list('#*',"@*"),
                       selection = "remove",
                       min_nchar = 3)
topfeatures(features, 40) %>% 
  knitr::kable("html")
```

## Top Features per Discipline

```{r results="asis"}
# {r results="asis"}
features <- dfm_select(joint_dfm, pattern = list('#*',"@*"),
                       selection = "remove",
                       min_nchar = 3)
topfeatures(features, 20, groups = "Discipline") %>% 
  map(knitr::kable, "html")
```

> There are still a couple features which would qualify for being removed (such as "unsere", "mal", "schon"), but we will take care of that with the super-useful `quanteda::dfm_trim(<term_freq>)` threshold-based feature selection.

> Plus, removing or parsing hashtags and applying `dfm(stem = TRUE)` would largely increase descriptive accuracy

## Network of feature co-occurrences
```{r}
topfeats <- names(topfeatures(joint_dfm, 60))
textplot_network(dfm_select(joint_dfm, topfeats), min_freq = 0.8)
```

## Grouped wordcloud of features

> "wordcloud, where the feature labels are plotted with their sizes proportional to their numerical values in the dfm" (Vignette for `quanteda::textplot_wordcloud`)


```{r fig.width=10, fig.asp=1}
textplot_wordcloud(joint_dfm_grouped,
                   comparison = TRUE,
                   min_size = 0.5,
                   max_size = 3,
                   max_words = 60)
```

> Topic Modelling!

Now that I had to spend quite an amount of time on data processing, cleaning, and eventually building a usable `dfm`, the actual analysis of the contents remains a \#TODO

> However, I learned a lot doing this today, and I hope that it became obvious that dealing with text as data is not to be underestimated.
