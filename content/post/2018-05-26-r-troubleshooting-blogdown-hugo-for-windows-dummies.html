<p>(This was written [especially] for an audience as Windows-noobish (and therefore GUI-driven and CLI-hostile) as myself. The post became rather exhaustive because it seems that running Blogdown (and a lot of other packages) on Windows is rather less documented, and figuring out how to get CLI-based Hugo running again helped me a lot to get more familiar with Windows as an evironment for heavily Linux/UNIX driven tools. So I hope that me documenting my problem-solving approach might help others to figure out their way out of similar scenarios.)</p>

<p>Recently – totally motivated by the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TidyTuesday">#TidyTuesday</a>-spirit from the magnificent <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash">#Rstats</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/R4DS?src=hash">#R4DS</a> community, I finally forced myself to set up <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown</a> with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> &amp; <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>Following Blogdown (and <a href="https://bookdown.org/">Bookdown(!)</a>) creator <a href="https://twitter.com/xieyihui">Yihui Xie</a>’s <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">book-ish manual</a>, it took me less than an hour to see an older <code>.Rmd</code> notebook of mine being rendered as a <code>.html</code> on MY first-ever <a href="https://ellocke.github.io/">personal website</a>. In case you’ve not been “Blogdowning” your stuff yet, you should know that running Blogdown from within RStudio gives you the convenient <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> function, which immediately previews any saved edits to your posts (whether <code>.Rmd</code> or plain <code>.md</code>) in RStudio’s viewer pane – before you have to publish them online.</p>
<p><strong>Amazing</strong>, right?</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">(<em>This is what writing this post looks in my RStudio. Notice the preview pane on the bottom right.</em>)</p>
</div>
<p><strong>A Word of Caution</strong></p>
<p>Notice how Xie et al. actually have included a predictive word of <strong>caution</strong> – full of wisdom, q.e.d.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If you do not understand HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and have no experience with Hugo themes or templates, it may take you about <strong>10 minutes to get started</strong> with your new website, since you have to accept everything you are given (such as the default theme); if you do have the knowledge and experience (and desire to highly customize your site), it may take you <strong>several days</strong> to get started. Hugo is really powerful. Be cautious with power.”</em> (<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/other-themes.html">Xie et al. 2018, Ch. 1.6, <em>emphasis added</em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, after going straight<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> after (re-)publishing my first ever written <em>500-lines-of-code-with-binaries</em>-<a href="https://ellocke.github.io/post/r-low-budget-high-res-mapping-with-r-for-not-for-profit-print/">tutorial</a>, the preview function suddenly stopped working and <strong>I couldn’t figure out why</strong>. After numerous brute-force-ish re-set-ups of Blogdown and/or my git page repo[s]<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I was finally able to pin-point the problem and get the crucial <code>hugo -v</code> debugging command running. From here on, it was a piece of cake. <em>But</em>…</p>
<p>Since there seemed to be only a few hints at my exact problem – which is rather a stack of interdependent problems (and which I’m gonna describe in a minute) and no tailored working solution, I decide to write down what I’ve encountered and what eventually did the job for me. Depending on how many more “problems” I might encounter in my future blogdown-blogging “career” I will update this post from time to time.</p>
</div>
<div id="my-problem-space-working-enivironment" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> My <del>Problem Space</del> Working Enivironment</h1>
<p><em>(Spoiler: It’s Windows, Stupid!)</em></p>
<p>OK, so let’s briefly have a look at my environment in which I set up Blogdown &amp; Hugo &amp; GitHub Pages. This actually should be true for any <strong>basic</strong> R @ Windows 10 user.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Linux / Ubuntu subsystem installed</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>) (&lt;– highly recommended!)</p></li>
<li><strong>blogdown</strong>: The RProject for my blogdown website (=source) is located in my local GitHub folder since it has been initialized as a repo <code>&lt;GitHubPage_Raw&gt;</code>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> However, I’m working with two folders = two repos.
<ul>
<li><strong>config.toml</strong>: I’ve decided to re-locate the page’s <code>\public</code> folder to my <code>&lt;myRepo.github.io&gt;</code> repo<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and therefore to separate the page’s (raw) source from the rendered output.</li>
<li><strong>Hugo</strong>: installed with <code>blogdown::install_hugo()</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>GitHub Page</strong>: That’s for a different topic, actually, but since I’ve separated my blogdown page source from the <code>/public</code> folder, it’s somehow relevant to my problem. To sum up, my raw page source and thereby editing environment is located in <code>%HOMEPATH%\Documents\GitHub\&lt;GitHubPage_Raw&gt;\</code><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and the rendered website is located in <code>%HOMEPATH%\Documents\GitHub\&lt;myRepo.github.io&gt;\</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And suddently there was no Preview</strong></p>
<p>At some point, <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> stopped previewing my edits and executing this command gave no error message. At the same time, the .Rmd files would still render / output properly. I was able to <code>git push</code> them to my <code>&lt;myRepo.github.io&gt;</code> and see the <code>html</code> posts on <a href="https://ellocke.github.io/" class="uri">https://ellocke.github.io/</a>. I wrongly supposed that this had been caused by messing around with the theme’s CSS or the <code>config.toml</code> file, but even with the default theme and/or <code>config.toml</code> the preview in RStudio would not launch.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-debug-hugo-esp.-on-windows" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> How to Debug Hugo (esp. on Windows)</h1>
<p>As suggested in almost any resource on Blogdown &amp; Hugo issues (<a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/517">cf. here</a>), running <code>hugo -v</code> should be your first step.</p>
<p>Of course, on Windows that’s neither working from CMD nor from RStudio’s terminal by default, since both do not know what the <code>hugo</code> command is supposed to be or where to find the binary. What’s next?</p>
<div id="where-is-carmen-sandiego-hugo" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Where is <del>Carmen Sandiego</del> Hugo?</h2>
<p>Eventually, I came up with 3 approaches and would recommend the third one. If you’ll continue blogging with Blogdown/Hugo on a regular basis, this seems to be the most convenient result (!= effort).</p>
<p><strong>Hugo &amp; Windows / Windows 10</strong></p>
<p>On Windows 10, by using the default approach with <code>blogdown::install_hugo()</code> in R/RStudio, the <code>hugo.exe</code> will be saved to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>C:\Users\&lt;YourAccount&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Hugo\hugo.exe</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to <em>grab</em> it you can either click-through your way to the (by default <strong>hidden</strong>) AppData folder in Explorer, OR <code>cd &lt;folder&gt;</code> there via CMD <strong>OR</strong> (which is far more elegant) simply use</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>%APPDATA%\Hugo</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>in CMD or Explorer’s address field.</p>
<p>So we found it. However, calling the debugger here won’t work since <code>hugo.exe</code> actually needs your site’s <code>config.toml</code>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/hugo_troubles/hugo_config.jpg" title="CMD: no config.toml" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p>In order to run Hugo’s debugger on your site you need to execute <code>hugo -v</code> in your site’s source root folder (that’s where the <code>config.toml</code> file is located). In my case it’s in <code>C:\Users\Locke\Documents\GitHub\GithubPage</code> which can be generalized to</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>%HOMEPATH%\Documents\GitHub\GitHubPage\</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the folder where we somehow need to execute <code>hugo -v</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-3-methods-to-run-hugo--v" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> The 3 Methods to run hugo -v</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="#quick-dirty"><strong>Quick &amp; Dirty</strong>: just the CMD</a></li>
<li><a href="#stable"><strong>Stable</strong>: PATH-variable + CMD</a></li>
<li><a href="#sophisticated-with-windows.linux"><strong>Sophisticated</strong>: RStudio’s terminal + Linux</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="quick-dirty" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Quick &amp; Dirty</h3>
<p>Launch Windows CMD, go to your (raw!) page’s source with</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>cd %HOMEPATH%\Documents\GitHub\GitHubPage\</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then execute <code>hugo -v</code> by calling it from afar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>%APPDATA%\Hugo\hugo.exe -v</code> OR <code>%APPDATA%\Hugo\hugo -v</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will finally see some feedback and should be searching for any lines starting with <code>ERROR</code>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/hugo_troubles/hugo_error_quick.jpg" title="Preview in RStudio" alt="Notice the last line and then lines 4-8: There are some (data file) binaries, which Hugo can’t render" style="width:100.0%" />
<p class="caption">Notice the last line and then lines 4-8: There are some (data file) binaries, which Hugo can’t render</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Fix ’em</strong></p>
<p>In my case, it was the data files for my .Rmd notebooks (<code>.csv</code> data, <code>.tif</code> basemap, and processed R data objects exported as <code>.rda</code>. So what I needed to do here was to add these data types to the <code>ignoreFiles = []</code> parameter in <code>config.toml</code>. This parameter now looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>ignoreFiles = [&quot;\\.Rmd$&quot;, &quot;\\.Rmarkdown$&quot;, &quot;_files$&quot;, &quot;_cache$&quot;, &quot;\\.csv$&quot;, &quot;\\.rda$&quot;, &quot;\\.tif$&quot;]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mission achieved! <strong>Well, partly…</strong>. You fixed what you needed to, but are you going to be able to easily redo this the next time you run into Hugo problems? Let’s say when you write your next in post in like a couple of months or so? I probably wouldn’t. Remember: <code>hugo -v</code> is your first option and you need to run it in your page’s source folder. Therefore, we might want to register Hugo (or rather <code>hugo.exe</code>) with Windows as a USER variable and make launching Hugo a stable method.</p>
</div>
<div id="stable" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Stable</h3>
<p>Follow <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#for-windows-10-users">this steps from Hugo’s offical documentation</a> and simply add <code>%APPDATA\Hugo</code> (or an absolute path, if you managed to put hugo.exe somewhere else) to the user <code>path</code> variable. Reboot Windows.</p>
<p>Now you just need to launch a <strong>CMD</strong> or PowerShell (i.e. by Shift + right-click in Explorer) in your page’s source folder or launch the CMD/PowerShell from anywhere else and <code>cd &lt;folder&gt;</code> your way to the source. Now just run <code>hugo -v</code> without any references:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/hugo_troubles/hugo_error_stable.jpg" title="plain hugo -v in action" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p><strong>Alternativly</strong>, you can even use RStudio’s Terminal for both methods, if CMD/PowerShell is set up as your default Shell. You can do this by <code>Menu-&gt;Tools-&gt;Global Options-&gt;Terminal-&gt;Shell</code>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/hugo_troubles/rstudio_terminal.jpg" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p>Either call <code>hugo -v</code> from afar, or set the path variable and run it without reference.</p>
<p>Voila! We did some nice stuff for your average Windows user. <strong>However</strong>, there’s one even more elegant and streamlined way which I totally would suggest to set up and use for your standard workflow.</p>
</div>
<div id="sophisticated-with-windows.linux" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Sophisticated with “Windows.Linux”&quot;</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">documented here</a>, with recent Windows 10 builds you can now implant a Linux subsystem (i.e. Ubuntu) into your Windows environment. So if you decided so install Linux for your Windows system, make sure, that <code>bash</code> is your default shell (see above) and launch a Terminal in RStudio (<code>Menu-&gt;Tools-&gt;Terminal-&gt;New Terminal</code> or <code>Alt+Shift+T</code>).</p>
<p>Install hugo into your Linux environment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>apt-get install hugo</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When this is done, run <code>hugo -v</code> in the Terminal anytime without ever leaving RStudio.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> We don’t need to navigate nowhere (if you’re running the command from you site’s source’s project in R). We don’t need to set a user path variable. <strong>We’re done.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="some-other-common-errors-troubles-with-blogdownhugo-updated" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Some other common Errors / Troubles with Blogdown/Hugo (Updated)</h1>
<p>When running <code>blogdown:::serve_site()</code> or trying to render your website by other means you might encounter one of the following warning messages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘—did you forget a’#‘? at line 1&gt;<code>seImpl(path.expand(input)</code>, verbose, fromFile):<br />
Unidentified trailing character’<br />
* Retrying in <em>X</em> seconds…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Error in <code>tomlparseImpl(path.expand(input)</code>, verbose, fromFile) :<br />
Unidentified trailing character ‘l’—did you forget a ‘#’? at line <strong>XY</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>OR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>something ending with <code>Error in render_page(f)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s probably because you either made (<strong>legit</strong>) changes to your <code>config.toml</code> while the preview was still running or you made a syntactical <strong>mistake</strong> to your <code>config.toml</code> or your <code>.Rmd</code> post’s <code>yaml</code>-header while/before the preview was running. In these cases the preview fails to (re-)render.</p>
<div id="seimpl-updated-resolved" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> <del>seImpl()</del> (Updated / resolved)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="https://github.com/ellocke/GithubPage/issues/1#issue-339175165" target="_blank">As Yihui has pointed out</a>, the <code>seImpl()</code> problem was Windows-specific and has been fixed in <code>blogdown v.0.7</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><del>For <code>seImpl</code> (appears to mostly concern legit changes to config.toml) it seems that simply restarting the R session helps. Just run the following command in the console, and everything should be fine:</del></p>
<pre class="r"><code>.rs.restartR() # keep the leading &quot;.&quot;
blogdown::serve_site()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="tomlparseimpl" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> tomlparseImpl()</h2>
<p>For <code>tomlparseImpl</code> (syntactical error in config.toml) you usually get a pointer <code>at line **XY**</code>. Double-check what you did there, undo it when in doubt, and then restart your session and try previewing again.</p>
<p>So far, that’s the three most common troubles / errors I ran into while working with Blogdown &amp; Hugo. As soon as I have figured out a <strong>pain</strong>-free way to run my GitHub Page from a sub-folder of the repo (i.e. <code>repo/html/index.html</code> or <code>repo/src/index.html</code> or <code>repo/docs/index.html</code> (which weirdly does not work if you use <code>https://youraccount.github.io</code> as your page) I’ll probably run into new problems (I actually did, already, by trying), I’ll document them here or link to a new post.)</p>
</div>
<div id="render_pagef" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> render_page(f)</h2>
<p>This corresponding error message might look like this &gt;Fehler in yaml::yaml.load(string, …) : &gt; Parser error: while parsing a block mapping at line 1, column 1 did not find expected key at line 1, column 12 &gt;Ruft auf: local … parse_yaml_front_matter -&gt; yaml_load_utf8 -&gt; <Anonymous> &gt;Ausführung angehalten &gt;<simpleError in render_page(f): Failed to render 'content/post/2018-05-27-some-tricks-when-working-with-blogdown-hugo-working-draft.Rmd'></p>
<p>This happened when I manually changed the <code>title</code> and <code>slug</code> of a post. After getting the error message I renamed the corresponging <code>.Rmd</code>. This makes sense but didn’t do the trick. What I noticed however, was that the page’s title in the <code>yaml</code> header was not surrounded by quotation marks (“” / ’’) anymore. After adding them and relaunching blogdown::serve_site() everything was fine again. But seriously:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t rename your stuff by hand. Always use RStudio’s <code>Update Metadata</code> function (via Addins)</p>
