# Repo for Ellocke's GithubPageThis is the repository for the source files of my GitHub Page https://ellocke.github.io/Apart from my `.Rmd` notebooks I try to include any (binary) data files in the `/data` folder. If the file size is too large (i.e. raster map files), the data's source is documented in the `.Rmd` and the post.You can find the modifications to the site's theme ("Theme-Even") in `\static\css\custom.css`
