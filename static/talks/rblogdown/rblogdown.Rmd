Even if you have a referral, the ability to show potential employers what you can do instead of just telling them you can do something is important."

# Why? Visibility!

> "The most effective strategy for me was doing **public work**. I blogged and did a lot of open source development late in my PhD, and these helped give public evidence of my data science skills." (["@drob" Robinson 2018](https://blog.modeanalytics.com/data-scientists-making-the-leap-academia-to-industry/))

> "A well-designed and maintained website can be extremely helpful for other people **to know you**, and you do not need to wait for suitable chances at conferences or other occasions to introduce yourself in person to other people." ([Yihui 2018](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/))

___

> "On the other hand, a website is also highly useful for yourself to **keep track** of what you have done and thought. Sometimes you may go back to a certain old post of yours to **relearn the tricks or methods** you once mastered in the past but have forgotten." ([Yihui 2018](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/))

# R + Markdown = RMarkdown

--

.pull-left[.quote[
 "With R Markdown, you only need to maintain the **source** documents; all output pages can be automatically generated from source documents. This makes it much easier to maintain a website, especially when the website is related to **data analysis or statistical computing and graphics**.
___ 
When the source code is updated (e.g., the model or data is changed), your web pages can be **updated** accordingly and **automatically**. *There is no need to run the code separately and cut-and-paste again*. Besides the convenience, you gain **reproducibility** at the same time." ([Xie 2018](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/r-markdown.html))

.quote[
“If you do not understand HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and have no experience with Hugo themes or templates, it may take you about **10 minutes to get started** with your new website, since you have to accept everything you are given (such as the default theme); if you do have the knowledge and experience (and desire to highly customize your site), it may take you **several days** to get started. Hugo is really powerful. Be cautious with power.” ([Xie et al. 2018, Ch. 1.6](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/other-themes.html))
